Description:this rule ensures we use the right addapter in view position
Always use adapterPosition to get the position of a ViewHolder in Kotlin code. Do not use bindingAdapterPosition unless the project is explicitly upgraded to a RecyclerView version that supports it and there is a clear need (e.g., merged adapters in Java).

Reason:
bindingAdapterPosition is not available in the current version of the AndroidX RecyclerView library used by this project.
Using bindingAdapterPosition causes unresolved reference build errors in Kotlin.
adapterPosition is the standard and supported property for getting the ViewHolder position in Kotlin for this codebase.
Fix:
Replace any usage of bindingAdapterPosition with adapterPosition in all ViewHolder implementations.
Only consider bindingAdapterPosition if the project is upgraded and there is a specific advanced use case.
Summary:
This rule prevents build errors caused by referencing properties that do not exist in the current environment. Always use adapterPosition for compatibility and reliability.
