Description: this rule ensure we have the right room dependencies
Whenever you use Room annotations (such as @Entity, @Dao, @Database), you must add the required Room dependencies and enable kapt (Kotlin annotation processing) in your build.gradle.kts file.


## Project Rule: Always Add Room Dependencies and Enable KAPT When Using Room

Reason:
- If Room dependencies or kapt are missing, the annotation processor cannot generate the required code, resulting in build errors like `@error.NonExistentClass` and `incompatible types: NonExistentClass cannot be converted to Annotation`.
- This error is cryptic and can be avoided by always including the correct dependencies and plugins.

Fix
- Add the following to your dependencies block:
  ```kotlin
  implementation("androidx.room:room-runtime:2.6.1")
  kapt("androidx.room:room-compiler:2.6.1")
  implementation("androidx.room:room-ktx:2.6.1")
  ```
- Ensure you have `id("kotlin-kapt")` in your plugins block.
- Sync Gradle after making these changes.

Summary:
This rule prevents build failures caused by missing annotation processors for Room. Always add the required Room dependencies and enable kapt before using Room annotations in your codebase.
